Technical Considerations
Navigation: Use React Navigation with native stack navigator for smooth transitions

UI Components: Build with React Native Paper or create custom components

Styling: Use styled-components or React Native's StyleSheet

State Management: Context API for simpler state, Redux for complex state

Image Handling: Use FastImage for better performance with caching

Animations: React Native Reanimated for fluid animations

Platform Differences: Create platform-specific code where needed with Platform.OS

API Integration: Axios for API calls with proper error handling

Data Persistence: Use AsyncStorage or Realm for local storage

Testing: Jest for unit testing, Detox for E2E testing
