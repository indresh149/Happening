## 🧠 Technical Considerations

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Navigation** | React Navigation with native stack navigator for smooth transitions |
| **UI Components** | React Native Paper or custom components |
| **Styling** | `styled-components` or `StyleSheet` |
| **State Management** | Context API (simple), Redux (complex) |
| **Image Handling** | `react-native-fast-image` for caching and performance |
| **Animations** | React Native Reanimated |
| **Platform Differences** | Use `Platform.OS` for platform-specific logic |
| **API Integration** | Axios with proper error handling |
| **Data Persistence** | AsyncStorage or Realm |
| **Testing** | Jest (unit testing), Detox (E2E testing) |
